        <legend>REASON FOR ENROLLING INTO ALTSCHOOL</legend>
        <p>
          In 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a lockdown that
          spanned through almost a year. Schools were closed. Markets closed.
          Nobody could easily go to their work places nor find someone to talk
          to. I was locked indoors for days.
        </p>

        <p>
          And as I watched days slip into weeks, then into months, and then for
          longer months, I was helpless. It was at that time I discovered that I
          had no digital skill. I was alone in my world. I was made to feel all
          the more terrible as I read that most online companies made their most
          income that skyrocketed their growth at the time because of the fact
          that human activities got another domain which is online.
        </p>

        <p>
          Companies like google, Amazon, Youtube, Netflix and so on were looking
          to employ more Front end Engineers, Back-end Engineers, Cloud
          Practitioners and so many other skills. I though to myself that I
          could be one of those employed at that time if only I had the skill.
        </p>

        <p>
          This period became for me a re-awakening to self. I got motivated to
          join the Tech space and contribute towards providing solutions to many
          of the Tech problems of the modern man. This became my major
          background, motivation as well as reason for enrolling into ALtschool.
          Thanks to Hack Sultan too, who provided me with 50% tuition
          scholarship that helped to ameliorate the heavy burden of paying the
          full tuition for me.

        <legend>WHAT ARE MY GOALS?</legend>
        <p>
          Firstly, I am so happy and excited since having enrolled into
          Altschool. I believe that by getting admitted into Altschool, I am one
          step away towards achieveing my set out goals and objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, oneof my short term goals which i already kickstarted is to
          gain an Altschool certification as I go through my learning process
          after the period of one year which has already begun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, I will like to opt for Cloud Engineering as my major track in
          AltSchool. This is because of my interests in Cloud, Data and
          Artificial Intelligence
        </p>
        <p>
          After I graduate and secure an internship, I will love to seek further
          Cloud Certifications in Amazon and Google Cloud. It's my dream to
          secure a role in either Amazon or GCP companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the long term, I will further my education towards gaining
          certifications in Data Science as well as Machine Learning and
          Artificial Intelligence. I will also use my knowlegde to contribute to
          the development of Africa especially my country Nigeria. I hope to
          sponsor Tech education of young Enthusiasts. I will also like to build
          Tech compnaies in future that will serve the local needs of my people.
